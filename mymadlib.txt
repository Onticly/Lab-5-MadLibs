The <adjective> thing just happened a while ago. A liger that 
is from <place> fought with a <animal>. The liger made a 
" <funny-noise> !" and ran away with it's tail between it's legs.
After this <adjective> situation occured, <person's-name> wrote
about it in their urban survival guide of <thing>. I heard they
will be making a movie called "The Liger and the <plural-noun> ".
Someone mentioned that the liger was never seen again, but I don't
know maybe the beast will come back to pick another fight with a <noun> .
